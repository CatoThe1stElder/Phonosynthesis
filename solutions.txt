1. Axininca Campa
The underlying noun roots are identical to the bare noun. There is a lenition rule:
[-cor,-voice] → [-cons] / [+syl] ___
This formulation depends on notions of structure preservation, crucially assuming a
characterization of w as the [+labial] glide corresponding to /p/ and j as the [-labial] glide
corresponding to /k/.

2. Kikuria

There is a vowel harmony rule where a high vowel becomes a mid vowel before a
mid vowel (disregarding consonants), so that /huut-er-a/ becomes [hootera].

[+syl] → [-hi] / __ C0 [+syl,-hi]

3. Korean

The underlying roots are /ip, kup, kaph
, ciph
, tat, puth
, mək, čuk, ik, tak’, k’ak’, sək’/. All

consonants neutralize to plain unaspirated before another consonant.
[-son] → [-s.g., -c.g] / ___ C

4. Xavante
The 2nd person prefix is /ʔaj/, and /j/ assimilates completely to a following coronal
consonant.
[-cons,-back] → [+cor,αant,βvoice,γcont] / __[+cor,αant,βvoice,γcont]

5. Hungarian

The underlying forms are identical to the bare noun form, and the suffixes are /-ban/,
/-to:l/, /-nak/ (or harmonic variants). There is regressive voicing wherereby obstruents
agree in voicing with an immediately following obstruent (but not a sonorant).
[-son] → [αvoice] / ___ [-son,αvoice]

6. North Saami

The underlying form of the noun is identical to the essive form minus the affix /-in/.
Word-finally, there is massive neutralization of the consonant, and the challenge here is

extracting generalizations about these processes. All final consonants are coronal, non-
affricate, and voiceless unless sonorant. This can be expressed as one rule.

C → [+cor,-voice,-del.rel] / ___ #
The concept of structure preservation and “closest segment” is helpful here, explaining
why /dʒ
/ becomes [ʃ] and not [t] or [s].
Two puzzles will be the fact that /h/ becomes [t] and not [s], and /ð/ becomes [t].
In terms of features, these are stridency-preserving results, where the resulting coronal is
non-strident. (As it happens, another way to handle the problem of /ð/ is to assume that it
is actually /d/, since /d/ does lenite to [ð] intervocalically).
